			<hr class="space-horizontally">
			<p class="space2-horizontally">The SubBuilder part of this extension is accessed by clicking on the SB icon at the top of the popup window. In this mode, you can create and insert upto 10 subtitiles into a video for testing. After they are inserted, you can edit the subtitle so that it is at the right time and displays well in the video.</p>
			<p class="space2-horizontally">To add a subtitle to the SubBuilder list, click the plus button at the top of the popup window. This will bring up an entry that has two color boxes, two time frame boxes, a "Jump 2s Before" button, a "Pause/Play" button, and a text entry for the actual content of the subtitle. If you click on the "Colors" button on the bottom, you'll notice that the set colors are white for the font and black for the background. You can add a color, set the color, and from then on any subtitles you add from pressing plus will be created with the set colors.</p>
			<p class="space2-horizontally">The two color boxes represent the color of the text and the color of the background behind the text respectively. If you click on these boxes, you'll be able to change the color. If you hold SHIFT and middle click, you will copy whatever color the box has, and from then on, you can middle click a color box in order to paste that color.</p>
			<p class="space2-horizontally">The time boxes must be filled with the start time of the subtitle and the end time of the subtitle. If you middle click these time boxes, it will automatically set it to wherever you currently are in the video which is very useful for filling out the ending times of subtitles.</p>
			<p class="space2-horizontally">The two buttons do exactly what you'd expect from their name. "Jump 2s Before" is a button that will take you to 2s before the start time of a subtitle, assuming that you filled in a start time. This is useful to check if your start times match up well. The "Pause/Play" button simply lets you easily pause and play the video from the extension popup window.</p>
			
			<h2 class="space-horizontally no-margin-bottom">"Add Test Subs" Button:</h2>
			<hr class="space-horizontally">
			<p class="space2-horizontally no-margin-top">This button will insert the subtitles you have in the list into the video for testing. It removes any subtitles, if there are any, that were already added and replaces them with the ones in the list.</p>
			
			<h2 class="space-horizontally no-margin-bottom">"Add All to TextBox"/"Remove All from List" Buttons:</h2>
			<hr class="space-horizontally">
			<p class="space2-horizontally no-margin-top">This button is to be used when you are satisfied with the timing and look of your subtitles. It will take the subtitles and put them into the textbox on the main page of the extension popup window. The entries in the list will remain after pressing this button, so if you no longer need them, clear them with the "Remove All from List" button.</p>
			<p class="space2-horizontally no-margin-top">TIP:  When you are done with your subtitles, it might be worthwhile to keep the latest subtitle entry in the list so that you can compare timings with any new subtitles you make. Just make sure not to accidently add the same subtitle twice.</p>
			
			<h2 class="space-horizontally no-margin-bottom">"Colors" Button:</h2>
			<hr class="space-horizontally">
			<p class="space2-horizontally no-margin-top">This button will open up a menu for setting colors when a new subtitle entry is added to the list. "Add Color" will add a color entry which you can edit to change the text color and background color. If you click set, it will set those colors as the default colors when a new subtitle entry is added. If you click remove it will remove the color entry from the list.</p>
			<p class="space2-horizontally no-margin-top">The "Save Colors to Storage" button will save the current color entries for later use. Clicking on a Saved Colors entry and then clicking "Delete Current Colors from Storage" will remove that Saved Colors entry.</p>
